                    <p>A geo-fence is a virtual perimeter for a real-world geographic area. A geo-fence could be dynamically generated—as in a radius around a point location, or a geo-fence can be a predefined set of boundaries (such as school zones or neighborhood boundaries).

The use of a geo-fence is called geo-fencing, and one example of usage involves a location-aware device of a location-based service (LBS) user entering or exiting a geo-fence. This activity could trigger an alert to the device's user as well as messaging to the geo-fence operator. This info, which could contain the location of the device, could be sent to a mobile telephone or an email account.Geofencing used with locationized firearms can restrict those firearms to fire only in locations where their firing is permitted, thereby making them unable to be used elsewhere.

Geofencing is critical to telematics. It allows users of the system to draw zones around places of work, customer's sites and secure areas. These geo-fences when crossed by an equipped vehicle or person can trigger a warning to the user or operator via SMS or email.</p>

                    <h1 style="color:blue;">Field Force Tracking</h1>
                    <p>Field force tracking  is the capture of field sales or service information in real time using communications technology, typically handheld PDAs, wireless devices, tablet PCs or mobile phones. The captured data is transferred immediately to back-end systems (ERP, CRM or accounting systems) through wireless connectivity (Wi-Fi, 3G, satellite or GPRS). This instant capture of information reduces time delays, avoids manual double entry data errors and enhances field force productivity.

From an operations perspective, availability of field information in near real time allows a business to plan delivery schedules, reduce inventory and monitor and control the field workers. Field force automation is seen as beneficial to businesses in regard of customer relations, maintaining skills among the field workforce, and limiting the size of this workforce.

The biggest challenge in field force automation is in developing a simple, but usable, user interface for the hand held device or mobile, and connectivity at the location of information capture. Connectivity can be overcome by having a system which can retain the information captured in the device cache and later synchronize with back-end systems ("thick client").</p>

                    <p>Managers can map the outlets to be visited by the agents and also assign daily tasks.Task management is the process of managing a task through its life cycle. It involves planning, testing, tracking, and reporting. Task management can help either individual achieve goals, or groups of individuals collaborate and share knowledge for the accomplishment of collective goals.Tasks are also differentiated by complexity, from low to high.

Effective task management requires managing all aspects of a task, including its status, priority, time, human and financial resources assignments, recurrence, dependency, notifications and so on. These can be lumped together broadly into the basic activities of task management.Managing multiple individuals or team tasks may require specialized software, for example workflow or project management software.</p>

                    <p>Sales forecasting is the process of estimating future sales. Accurate sales forecasts enable companies to make informed business decisions and predict short-term and long-term performance. Companies can base their forecasts on past sales data, industry-wide comparisons, and economic trends.

It is easier for established companies to predict future sales based on years of past business data. Newly founded companies have to base their forecasts on less-verified information, such as market research and competitive intelligence to forecast their future business.Sales forecasting gives insight into how a company should manage its workforce, cash flow, and resources. In addition to helping a company allocate its internal resources effectively, predictive sales data is important for businesses when looking to acquire investment capital.</p>

                        <p>For companies with large numbers of employees doing fieldwork, field force effectiveness is a huge driver of overall cost, quality, safety and morale. PIP helps clients increase field force effectiveness in two ways: by focusing on reducing non-productive time and by making tool time safer and more productive.By analyzing sales force performance, managers can make changes to optimize sales going forward. Toward that end, there are many ways to gauge the performance of individual salespeople and of the sales force as a whole, in addition to total annual sales. In a survey of nearly 200 senior marketing managers, 54 percent responded that they found the sales force effectiveness metric very useful.

                        <p>Force-field analysis is a development in social science. It provides a framework for looking at the factors (forces) that influence a situation, originally social situations. It looks at forces that are either driving movement toward a goal (helping forces) or blocking movement toward a goal (hindering forces). Force Field Analysis is a general tool for systematically analyzing the factors found in complex problems. It frames problems in terms of factors or pressures that support the status quo (restraining forces) and those pressures that support change in the desired direction (driving forces).</p>
