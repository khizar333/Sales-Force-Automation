                <br />
                <p>Geo-fencing is a feature in a software program that uses the global positioning system (GPS) to define geographical boundaries.



<br />Geo-fencing allow an administrator to set up triggers so when a device enters (or exits) the boundaries defined by the administrator, an alert is issued.<br /> applications define boundaries by longitude and latitude or through user-created and Web-based maps.<br />
                    Geofence virtual barriers can be active or passive. Active geofences require an end user to opt-in to location services and a mobile app to be open. Passive geofences are always on; they rely on Wi-Fi and cellular data instead of GPS or RFID and work in the background.  </p>

Sometimes users want to use a particular app when they are in a specific type of location, such as an airport, or a supermarket. However, users have to navigate to that app and then take a specific action within it while they are near the area of interest.

The geofencing API allows you to define perimeters, also referred to as geofences, which surround the areas of interest. Your app gets a notification when the device crosses a geofence, which allows you to provide a useful experience when users are in the vicinity.</p>
            </div>

       <div class="col-md-6">
           <p style="text-align:center">
For example, an airline app can define a geofence around an airport when a flight reservation is near boarding time. When the device crosses the geofence, the app can send a notification that takes users to an activity that allows them to get their boarding pass.

The Geofencing API intelligently uses the device sensors to accurately detect the location of the device in a battery-efficient way.</p>
